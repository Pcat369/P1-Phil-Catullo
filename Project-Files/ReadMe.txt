THe Mage's Tower
Project Description:
When you're an adventurer looking for magic supplies, it can always be hard to find the kind of quality that will help you out in the wilderness.
The Mage's Tower can meet all your adventuring needs. With supplies from the sunny Summerset Isles, and locations as far north as snowy Skyrim, you can always find what you need. 
Our stores allow anyone from Skyrim to Cyrodiil and beyond to purchase the supplies any aspiring adventurer needs to face challenges all across Tamriel.
